# Software Functionality

The software provides an interactive tool for simulating genetic inheritance in guinea pigs (*Cavia porcellus*), applying post-Mendelian laws. It allows for the inference of genotypes and phenotypes of the progeny resulting from crossings between individuals.

## 1. Genotype Inference

Guinea pigs are represented as genetic objects, each with a set of alleles that determine traits such as fur length and texture, color, ear shape, and sex. When performing a cross between two guinea pigs, the software employs genetic algorithms to combine the parental genotypes and determine the offspring's genotypes, following Mendelian laws and other post-Mendelian genetic principles.

## 2. Phenotype Inference

The process of phenotype inference in the software involves using base textures designed by the programmer. These base textures contain predefined colors, such as blue, green, among others. The programmer designs three base textures representing different parts of the guinea pig's body, such as fur, ears, nose, etc.

During program execution, the computer uses these base textures as references to generate an infinite variety of textures, depending on the phenotypes calculated for the offspring. The original texture serves as a template to determine different parts of the guinea pig, allowing the program to paint them with the corresponding colors based on inherited genes.

This approach ensures an accurate visual representation of the guinea pigs' physical characteristics, providing a richer and more detailed user experience in simulating genetic inheritance. This technology allows for up to a total of 96 computer-generated textures without having to draw them one by one.

# Potential Applications

1. **Scientific Research:** Allows for the simulation and study of genetic inheritance in guinea pigs to better understand underlying biological and genetic processes.

2. **Education:** Provides an interactive tool for teaching advanced concepts of Mendelian and post-Mendelian genetics.

3. **Guinea Pig Breeders:** Facilitates the selection of guinea pigs for breeding with desirable traits, thereby optimizing the genetic improvement process of the species.

# Usage Considerations

- **Genetic Accuracy:** While the software is based on solid genetic principles, it should be noted that results may vary due to the model's simplification and the application of post-Mendelian laws.

- **Version 1.1:** The game currently does not support mobile devices.
